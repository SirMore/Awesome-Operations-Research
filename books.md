MOSEK Modeling Cookbook How to formulate and reformulate conic optimization problems (convex QP, SOCP, SDP, Exponential Cone, Power Cone, and mixed integer). Requires some "mathematical maturity" to understand. This is very helpful for users of CVX, CVXPY, CVXR, YALMIP. Note, this is complementary to H.P. Williams "Model building in mathematical programming", because Williams doesn't cover any conic optimization material.

G.B. Dantzig and M.N. Thapa Linear Programming 1: Introduction, Springer, 1997 and Linear Programming 2: Theory and Extension, Spinger, 2003. Linear Programming 2, especially, is hard-core.
